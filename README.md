Hi, I’m @pranavshhh.
I’m interested in Software Engineering, Web Dev, and more using Python/C++ and their libraries.
I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms, the REST Framework, and development of CRUD apps.
If you are looking for someone to collaborate with, reach out to me! I would prefer to work in Python, but am willing to learn more languages/technologies.
Reach me on LinkedIn or my email here: linkedin.com/pranavshhh / shuklapr@msu.edu
